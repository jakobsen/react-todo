# Do your shit ðŸ’©

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5b028116-a00c-4c5a-9a66-3d0327f9ea4b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/do-your-shit/deploys)

This is a terrible todo-app that should not be used by anyone.
A live demo is available [here](https://do-your-shit.netlify.app/).

It was built for the sole purpose of learning [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/).

If you would like to fork it to make it less terrible, be my guest.
