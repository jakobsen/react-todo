# Do your shit ðŸ’©

This is a terrible todo-app that should not be used by anyone.
A live demo is available [here](https://do-your-shit.netlify.app/).

It was built for the sole purpose of learning [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/).

If you would like to fork it to make it less terrible, be my guest.
